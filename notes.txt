to implement
-Email or Discord DM notification
-Audit log: who approved, when, admin note, etc.
-Real-time updates using WebSockets (Flask-SocketIO)
-date/time input formatting so your example 1.1.2026 17:00-19:00 displays nicely on the dashboard
-admin can update the pending request to request more information which user needs to specify
-when admin declines he can also add comment to why it was declined


-cant test because no channels, need to create funciton for admin to create channels
managed to create this thing but need to test admin page more. view all gives error, dosent render page
