to implement

Not critical but would be nice:
-Email or Discord DM notification
-Audit log: who approved, when, admin note, etc.
-Real-time updates using WebSockets (Flask-SocketIO)

Next up coming:
-date/time input formatting so your example 1.1.2026 17:00-19:00 displays nicely on the dashboard
    -if time from and time to is the same date then it should only display 1.1.2026 and not 1.1.2026-1.1.2026
-admin can update the pending request to request more information which user needs to specify
-when admin declines he can also add comment to why it was declined
